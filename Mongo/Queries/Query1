Question
A leading beverage company has announced a billion-dollar fund for removing debris from forests, rivers and mountains in the US. All states are interested. Which state has the least chance to win a share of the fund?

Notes/Comments About MongoDB Query/Code and Results (Include # of Documents in Result)

1. We have considered the same assumptions as with SQL query, i.e. assumed every entry as a wildfire and filtered stat_cause_code as “Debris Burning” and accounting for the least count because of proportional fund share for number of wildfires.
2. We have limited the row count to 1 as we are interested in obtaining the least state that wished to win a share of the fund. Hence Number of rows in result -> 1

Translation

Cleanup -> Find the state which has least count for wildfires with stat cause as ”Debris Burning” 

Translation -> Display state with least count for wildfires with stat_cause_code = ”Debris Burning”

Code -> db.fires.aggregate({$match:{STAT_CAUSE_DESCR:”Debris Burning”}}, {$group:{_id:”$STATE”,count:{$sum:1}}},{$sort:{count:1}})
