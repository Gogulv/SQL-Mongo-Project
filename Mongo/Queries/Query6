Question
Which forest had the least number of fires?

Notes/Comments About MongoDB Query/Code and Results (Include # of Documents in Result)

1.  We have considered the same assumptions as with the SQL query, i.e., every entry in the Fire table as a wildfire. We run the query to find the least number of fires for each forest and order by the name of the forest.

Our output contains documents which are grouped by forest name and respective wildfires count. The number of records obtained are 195. Thus, 195 forests have wildfires that have a count of 1 and are the least wildfires.

Translation

Cleanup -> find the forests which has the least number of fires 

Code -> display the forests and count of fires = 1 and sort the forests. 
db.fires.aggregate({$group:{_id:"$NWCG_REPORTING_UNIT_NAME",count:{$sum:1}}},{$sort:{count:1}},{$match:{count:{$eq:1}}}).itcount()
