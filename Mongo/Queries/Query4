Question
What were the forests that had no fires that lasted more than two days?

Notes/Comments About MongoDB Query/Code and Results (Include # of Documents in Result)

1.  We have considered the same assumptions as with SQL query, i.e., assumed that every fire was discovered and contained in the same year. Hence, we subtract Discovery_DOY and contained_DOY which gives us the duration of fire.
2.  As we need to have fires no fires more than 2 days, we assume that 2 days means a difference of 1. i.e if Discovery_DOY is 200 and contained_DOY is 201, then their difference is 2 whereas absolute difference 

Our output contains documents grouped by forest names and count of fires in the forest that were contained before 2 days. We have obtained 1228 documents.

Translation

Cleanup -> Display the forests which had no fires which had not lasted more than 2 days

Translation -> Display the forests which had no fires with difference of Discovery_DOY and contained_DOY as 2 days

Code ->
db.fires.aggregate({$project:{ NWCG_REPORTING_UNIT_NAME:1,   Difference: {$abs :{$subtract:["$CONT_DOY","$DISCOVERY_DOY"]}} }},{$match:{Difference:{$lte:1}}},{$group:{_id:"$NWCG_REPORTING_UNIT_NAME", count : {$sum:1}}}).count()
