Question
One of the reporting agencies has suggested that children be banned from its forests unless there is one adult for every 3 children in a group visiting a forest. Name 3 forests where this would be the least appropriate.

Notes/Comments About MongoDB Query/Code and Results (Include # of Documents in Result)

1.	We have considered the same assumptions as with SQL query, i.e. assumed every entry as a wildfire
2.	We have filtered for STAT_CAUSE_DESC as “Children” to obtain the count of forests. We have assumed that to stop the fires due to children, we need to concentrate on forests where the fire is caused by children and enforce this rule. But if very least number of forest fires are caused by children, this rule is inefficient because we are wasting the adult supervision for the same. Hence, we have concentrated on forests with least count where this rule could be lease appropriate.
3.	We have obtained 3 rows with forest name and count of fires.

Translation

Cleanup -> Find the forests which have least no of fires caused by children

Translation -> Display the forests that have the least number of fires with STAT_CAUSE_DESCR as Children

Code -> db.fires.aggregate({$match:{STAT_CAUSE_DESCR:"Children"}},{$group:{_id:"$NWCG_REPORTING_UNIT_NAME",count:{$sum:1}}},{$sort:{count:1,_id:1}},{$limit:3})
