Question
A leading beverage company has announced a billion-dollar fund for removing debris from forests, rivers and mountains in the US. All states are interested. Which state has the least chance to win a share of the fund?

Notes/Comments About SQL Query and Results (Include # of Rows in Result)

1.	We have assumed that the fund share is directly proportional to the effort/amount of debris removed. Hence, we search for the least amount of debris involved in a forest of a state. Hence it is the least fires caused by debris.
2.	We have assumed that there is only one NWCG reporting unit agency corresponding to a specific forest and multiple source reporting agency can contribute towards a specific NWCG reporting unit agency. Hence each NWCG reporting agency is only associated with one forest and hence we assume NWCG reporting agency for forest name.
3.	We have filtered the stat_Cause_code for “Debris burning”. The question aims at solving for debris burning by monetary incentives for removing debris. 
4.	We have limited the row count to 1 as we are interested in obtaining the least state that wished to win a share of the fund. Hence Number of rows in result -> 1

Translation –
Clean up – select state and count of fires from fire table join stat_info table where stat_cause_desc is 'Debris Burning'
Translation – select state, count from fires join stat_info where stat_cause_desc is 'Debris Burning'

Code -
select F.state, count(F.fod_id) as size_of_fires from fire F join stat_info si on si.STAT_CAUSE_CODE=F.STAT_CAUSE_CODE1 where si.STAT_CAUSE_DESC='Debris Burning'  
 group by F.state  order by 2 asc limit 1;

We have limited the output to 1 to obtain the least wildfire count state. The count is 2 for state DC.
