Question
Which forest had the least number of fires?

Notes/Comments About SQL Query and Results (Include # of Rows in Result)
1. We assume every entry in the Fire table as a wildfire. We run the query to find the least number of fires for each forest and order by the name of the forest.

Our output contains records which are grouped by forest name and respective wildfires count. The number of records obtained are 195. Thus, 195 forests have wildfires that have a count of 1 and are the least wildfires.

Translation

Clean up -> Select the forest name and count of forests joining fires table, fpa_source_data table and  nwcgreporting table having count of forests as 1

Translation -> Select forest name, count from fires join fpa_source_data join nwcgreporting group by forest name having count = 1

Code ->
select nwcg_reporting_unit_name,count(F.FOD_ID) as count
from fire F  join fpa_source_data FSD on F.fpa_id1 = FSD.fpa_id 
 join nwcgreporting NWCG on FSD.NWCG_REPORTING_UNIT_ID1 = NWCG.NWCG_REPORTING_UNIT_ID
group by nwcg_reporting_unit_name having count(f.fod_id)=1
order by 2;
